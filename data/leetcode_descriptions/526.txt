Given an array of distinct strings words, return the minimal possible abbreviations for every word.

The following are the rules for a string abbreviation:

The initial abbreviation for each word is: the first character, then the number of characters in between, followed by the last character.
If more than one word shares the same abbreviation, then perform the following operation:

Increase the prefix (characters in the first part) of each of their abbreviations by 1.

For example, say you start with the words ["abcdef","abndef"] both initially abbreviated as "a4f". Then, a sequence of operations would be ["a4f","a4f"] -> ["ab3f","ab3f"] -> ["abc2f","abn2f"].


This operation is repeated until every abbreviation is unique.


At the end, if an abbreviation did not make a word shorter, then keep it as the original word.
