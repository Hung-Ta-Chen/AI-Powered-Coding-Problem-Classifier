If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by an array of three-digit integers. For each integer in this array:

The hundreds digit represents the depth d of this node where 1 <= d <= 4.
The tens digit represents the position p of this node in the level it belongs to where 1 <= p <= 8. The position is the same as that in a full binary tree.
The units digit represents the value v of this node where 0 <= v <= 9.

Given an array of ascending three-digit integers nums representing a binary tree with a depth smaller than 5, return the sum of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

It is guaranteed that the given array represents a valid connected binary tree.
