You are given an array of points on the X-Y plane points where points[i] = [xi, yi]. The points form a polygon when joined sequentially.

Return true if this polygon is convex and false otherwise.

You may assume the polygon formed by given points is always a simple polygon. In other words, we ensure that exactly two edges intersect at each vertex and that edges otherwise don't intersect each other.
