A series of highways connect n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array highways where highways[i] = [city1i, city2i, tolli] indicates that there is a highway that connects city1i and city2i, allowing a car to go from city1i to city2i and vice versa for a cost of tolli.

You are also given an integer discounts which represents the number of discounts you have. You can use a discount to travel across the ith highway for a cost of tolli / 2 (integer division). Each discount may only be used once, and you can only use at most one discount per highway.

Return the minimum total cost to go from city 0 to city n - 1, or -1 if it is not possible to go from city 0 to city n - 1.
