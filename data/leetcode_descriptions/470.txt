Given a string s, encode the string such that its encoded length is the shortest.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. k should be a positive integer.

If an encoding process does not make the string shorter, then do not encode it. If there are several solutions, return any of them.
