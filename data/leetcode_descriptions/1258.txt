You are given an even number of people numPeople that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else so that there are numPeople / 2 handshakes total.

Return the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross.

Since the answer could be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
