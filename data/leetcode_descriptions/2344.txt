You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array peaks where peaks[i] = [xi, yi] states that mountain i has a peak at coordinates (xi, yi). A mountain can be described as a right-angled isosceles triangle, with its base along the x-axis and a right angle at its peak. More formally, the gradients of ascending and descending the mountain are 1 and -1 respectively.

A mountain is considered visible if its peak does not lie within another mountain (including the border of other mountains).

Return the number of visible mountains.
