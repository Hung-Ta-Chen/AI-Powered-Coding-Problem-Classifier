You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in a connected undirected graph containing exactly one cycle. The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [node1i, node2i] denotes that there is a bidirectional edge connecting node1i and node2i in the graph.

The distance between two nodes a and b is defined to be the minimum number of edges that are needed to go from a to b.

Return an integer array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the minimum distance between the ith node and any node in the cycle.
