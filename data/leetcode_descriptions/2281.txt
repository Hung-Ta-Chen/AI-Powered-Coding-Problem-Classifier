You are given an m x n 0-indexed 2D array of positive integers heights where heights[i][j] is the height of the person standing at position (i, j).

A person standing at position (row1, col1) can see a person standing at position (row2, col2) if:

The person at (row2, col2) is to the right or below the person at (row1, col1). More formally, this means that either row1 == row2 and col1 < col2 or row1 < row2 and col1 == col2.
Everyone in between them is shorter than both of them.

Return an m x n 2D array of integers answer where answer[i][j] is the number of people that the person at position (i, j) can see.
