You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of n non-negative integers.

You are also given an array queries, where queries[i] = [xi, yi]. The answer to the ith query is the sum of all nums[j] where xi <= j < n and (j - xi) is divisible by yi.

Return an array answer where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is the answer to the ith query modulo 109 + 7.
