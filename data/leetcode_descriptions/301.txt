You are given an m x n binary matrix image where 0 represents a white pixel and 1 represents a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers x and y that represents the location of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.

You must write an algorithm with less than O(mn) runtime complexity
