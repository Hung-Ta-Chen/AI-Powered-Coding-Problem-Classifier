Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to the y-axis that reflects the given points symmetrically.

In other words, answer whether or not if there exists a line that after reflecting all points over the given line, the original points' set is the same as the reflected ones.

Note that there can be repeated points.
