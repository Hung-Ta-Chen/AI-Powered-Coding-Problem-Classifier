You are given a 2D integer array items where items[i] = [pricei, weighti] denotes the price and weight of the ith item, respectively.

You are also given a positive integer capacity.

Each item can be divided into two items with ratios part1 and part2, where part1 + part2 == 1.

The weight of the first item is weighti * part1 and the price of the first item is pricei * part1.
Similarly, the weight of the second item is weighti * part2 and the price of the second item is pricei * part2.

Return the maximum total price to fill a bag of capacity capacity with given items. If it is impossible to fill a bag return -1. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be considered accepted.
