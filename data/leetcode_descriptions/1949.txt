You are given an integer array nums of size n. You are asked to solve n queries for each integer i in the range 0 <= i < n.

To solve the ith query:

Find the minimum value in each possible subarray of size i + 1 of the array nums.
Find the maximum of those minimum values. This maximum is the answer to the query.

Return a 0-indexed integer array ans of size n such that ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements in an array.
