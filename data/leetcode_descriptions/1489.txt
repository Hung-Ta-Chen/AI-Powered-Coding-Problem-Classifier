Given a root of an N-ary tree, return a deep copy (clone) of the tree.

Each node in the n-ary tree contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its children.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).
