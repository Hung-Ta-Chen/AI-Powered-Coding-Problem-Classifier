You are given an integer array stations that represents the positions of the gas stations on the x-axis. You are also given an integer k.

You should add k new gas stations. You can add the stations anywhere on the x-axis, and not necessarily on an integer position.

Let penalty() be the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations after adding the k new stations.

Return the smallest possible value of penalty(). Answers within 10-6 of the actual answer will be accepted.
